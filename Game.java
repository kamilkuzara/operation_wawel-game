/**
 *  This class is the main class of the "Operation Wawel" application. 
 *  "Operation Wawel" is a very involving, text based adventure game. 
 *  The game is loosely based on historical events of World War II.
 *  The player's goal is to explore the Wawel Castle, in which precious artwork
 *  is kept, collect that artwork and safely get it out of the building.
 *  There are a number of things that are to make it a challenge. Some of the
 *  rooms are closed and can only be opened with a key, there are enemies 
 *  that will try to attack the player.
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  method.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, characters and items, creates the parser and starts the game.
 *  It also evaluates and executes the commands that the parser returns.
